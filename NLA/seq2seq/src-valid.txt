hate missing the bus
you are a completely unreasonable person to think violence is a solution
shit day as lost my wallet 
hate cleaning the mess after eating
shameful that i was charged for a canceled order
sad that women's right came so late
swimming lessons are very costly in nyc
fuel like oil and gasoline prices will be rising in fall

huge mismanagement that the system was never launched
awkward that i was ignored in my friend's plan
i despise listening to your explanation

pissed on whoever screwed my sister's car
people get offended with my opinion
its damn cold and freezing since its snowing
irritated that am getting work emails early on monday morning
hate when the fire alarm goes off and have to walk home in pouring rain outside
money can not buy knowledge
feeling sick and whole week going to be doctors appointments , xrays and injections
stop cribbing foolish, you can change the settings from control panel
my friends don not talk to me
i hate waiting at the doctor's office
very stupid of her for saying that

you are a bad friend
we are wasting money on irrelevant things rather than canceling student loans
feel destroyed being ignored and waiting forever
feel disheartened being the second choice all the time

this place is boring and serious
i feel so useless
repelled by a all day long classes after a stressful weekend
loathe missing the bus

sad that i cant afford to go to france because of capitalism
