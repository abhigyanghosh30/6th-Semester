hate not getting enough sleep and then waking up early
these jerks provided were very unsupportive

business profits from getting money from people

i despise sweeping
the land of the lost is a horrible tv show

one game should not decide and change opinions
i am a rude guy
i don not enjoy doing maths
devastated by three bad days in a row
